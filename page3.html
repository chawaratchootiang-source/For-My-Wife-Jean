      <p>To my favorite person,

You are the most hardworking and amazing person I know. Even when you complain, you always get things done, and everyone around you—your peers and superiors—recognizes your talent. I’m not at all surprised because you truly are incredible. I feel so lucky to have such a beautiful, talented, and inspiring girlfriend. You deserve all the happiness and success in the world.

In just six months, we’ll finally be together, and I promise to make every moment special for you. I want to take you wherever your heart desires and make you feel as loved and cherished as you make me feel every day. I love you more than words can express, and I can’t wait to spend my life with you. You are my everything, and I wish you all the happiness life has to offer.</p>
